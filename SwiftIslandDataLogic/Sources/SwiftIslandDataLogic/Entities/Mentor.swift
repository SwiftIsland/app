That moment sparked my career as an iOS developer, starting with the SDK a year later. I've since experienced every major Apple release: the iPad, various iPhone and iPad models, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. Vision Pro and visionOS have been as revolutionary for me as the iPhone and iOS. I\'ve been deeply involved with this new platform since its keynote and even more so since the SDK release and my visit to Apple in Munich. I ordered Vision Pro the day it was available and will bring it to Texel â€” the revolution has begun.", imageName: "speaker-manu-2024", name: "Manu Carrasco Molina", twitter: nil, web: "https://carrascomolina.com/", linkedIn: "carrascomolina", mastodon: nil, order: 6),
